Analysis-MatrixMultiplication

This is a final year project but consider this my final project for first year:

Let's take a very simple, useful algorithm: dense matrix multiplication.
 It has been studied for decades and there are a lot of algorithms out there.

1) Implement several of these algorithm in multiple languages and 
    run them using various matrix sizes on machines you have access to. 
    You'll get some nice-looking graphs and not a lot more.

2) Using the assembly code and hardware performance counters, 
     explain why (at an architectural level) certain algorithms are faster than others. 
     That's well beyond what I would expect a new undergrad to be able to do.

3) Using your knowledge of the processor architecture, 
     reason about what the fastest possible speed is for this problem 
     --- what is the theoretical upper bound on performance? 
     (Now you're doing computer science.)

4) Hand-tune your code (probably in assembly) to get as close as you can to your theoretical bound.

This was (roughly speaking) the project I gave an undergraduate computer science student I mentored over the summer
. He was pretty sharp and made quite a bit of progress. 
If you can do similar work as a high school student, definitely drop me a line.
 I can point you to a few professors who would be interested to have you in their classes.
